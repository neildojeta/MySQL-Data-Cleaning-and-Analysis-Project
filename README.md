# MySQL-Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis-Project

# Things to take note on this project:
1. The "layoffs" csv file contains the raw and uncleaned data.
2. The "world_layoffs" MySQL file contains the complete project.
   I created two staging tables so that there is a copy of the raw table.
   "layoff_staging2" is the cleaned table of the data.
3. "MySQL_DATA_ANALYSIS_PROJECT" and "MySQL_DATA_CLEANING_PROJECT" contains the queries and steps
   used to clean and analyse the given data.
